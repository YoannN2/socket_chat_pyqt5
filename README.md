# socket_chat_pyqt5
Simple socket chat with a gui made with pyqt5 (from sentdex tuts)

## Dependencies:

```sh
pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
```
(not sure if that's all... boo)

## Getting started:

Run the server in a terminal :
```sh
python server.py
```

Run as many clients as you want in new terminals :
```sh
python client.py --username=<USER_NAME>
```

That's pretty much it :D
